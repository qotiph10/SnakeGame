# Snake Gameüêç

Welcome to the classic Snake game, recreated for the web using TypeScript! This project brings back the nostalgia of the iconic game from the early days of mobile phones, now playable in your browser.

## About the Game
The Snake game is a timeless classic where the player controls a growing snake, guiding it to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls or its own tail. This version is built using TypeScript, making it a modern take on a beloved retro game.

## How to Play
1. Use the **arrow keys** (‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üê, ‚Üí) to control the direction of the snake.
2. Guide the snake to eat the food (represented by a colored square) to grow longer.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the wall. Your final score will be displayed.

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: The game logic is written in TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability.
- **HTML/CSS**: The user interface is built using HTML and CSS for a clean and responsive design.
